bio-sqlite3 is library for sqlite3 that provides functions useful for bioinformtics. Primarily it is a proof of concept, let's be honest sqlite3 is not the best candidate for this, but it seems a sensible idea to add such functions to databases that will be used for storing sequences anyway and to get it to do the work.

Files:
	README.md	This file, duh!
	INSTALL.txt	How to make and use the library
	FUNCTIONS.txt	List of functions currently provided
	Makefile	Makefile to make the library
	*.c		The code
